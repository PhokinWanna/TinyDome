4.Then, think about how to start a Project, In STEP BY STEP (Like flowchart or Stepchart).
5.When Finish the flowchart, Have to doing belong the plan to PART BY PART (don't have to doing it in all at once). But, doing it in part. And then later, combine  each part together to make it into ONE PART (Like a jigsaw)
 or Product (Prototype).
6.Put everthing that was Fully successed into 1 PRODUCT (Prototype).
7.Put the prototype to test system, If find any pproblem (Sure! it have to had a problrm and even it was a tiny probelm), Have to record it in note or another subject and then find the way to solve that problem.
8.After the problem or the mistake has been SOLVED, Redo at MARK 7, Again, And Again and Again. Untill the product was successfully complete.
